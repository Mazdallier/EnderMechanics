Make machines use modified Ender Node renderer
	Shrink boxes down to 6-8px wide
	Make Machine Frame's inner box larger
Make Machine Frames insert a machine on right-click
	Machine Frame's tile entity holds IMachine, block and byte (meta)
	NBT I/O: block (by ID) and meta; create new tile when read
	TESR renders machine as well as itself
Make buses that can automate frames
Make machines completely un-automatable
	Add all of IInventory's methods to IMachine (They will be used when in a frame)
	Replace all references to IInventory with IMachine

Machines should only be automatable by inserting them into a Machine Frame
Using a frame, you can automate all the things
