Make machines metadata-based
Make misc. blocks (Machine Frame, Ender Node) metadata-based
Make machines use Ender Node rendering, distinguished by color, and completely un-automatable
---Checkpoint---
Take any ore, from any supported mod, and put it in the 5x-er: recieve 5 correct ingots
Mod should occupy 6 IDs: ingots, pearls, wrenches, machines, generators, misc. blocks
Machines should have no interaction with anything
----------------
Make machines use modified Ender Node renderer
Make Machine Frames insert a machine on right-click
Make buses that can automate frames
Make machines completely un-automatable (remove IInventory)
---Checkpoint---
Machines should only be automatable by inserting them into a Machine Frame
Inserting them into a frame should give near infinite possibilities
----------------
Add an info book, similar to Thaumonomicon
Add pages
Add entries to pages
---Checkpoint---
An outside mod should be able to:
	Add pages and entries to the lore book
	Create new tiers of wrenches and breakable blocks
	Create machines that follow nothing of any of my templates, but count anyway
	Create machines that all they have to do is plug in recipes and watch
	Create new tiers of Ender Nodes
----------------
