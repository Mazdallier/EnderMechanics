#Ender Mechanics Mod#
This is a partially-complete husk of a Minecraft mod that will add elements similar too, but unique from Applied Energistics 2, Thermal Expansion 4, ComputerCraft, Ender IO, and Thermal Dynamics, among others.
##Future Plans##
<b>I'm going to scrap *everything* and start over.</b>

This mod has gotten slightly out of hand. If feel like when I come back to this thing (that's a when, not an if), there's no way I'll understand the code, and there's an even smaller chance users will. So, I'm going to start over and give it some structure this time, rather than random items and blocks dropping all over the place.

The backstory for the mod will be the existence of a separate dimension, the Rift. (Everything after this will be put, basically unedited, into the "Thaumonomicon" of the mod.) The Rift is a near-infinite space with strange properties: it is comparatively easy to mold the fabric of space-time there. This is what allows Endermen to travel great distances so quickly, as their Pearls are able to transpose reality and the Rift into the same space for a limited time. You can take it much further.

You can harness the ability of the Pearls to create Rift Nodes (name WIP), which can interact with each other across the Rift. This allows you to connect many Nodes into networks. These networks can transport items, liquids, power, and more across vast areas of Overworld space in a ludicrously short time. However, the Nodes themselves have to be rather close in order to connect; Â±5 blocks on any coordinate will do.

You can insert foci into the Nodes. This will allow them to not only act in a network, but also to process items in some way. The Infernal Focus, for example, will smelt any items that are pulled in by the Node.

To transfer things between the Rift and the Overworld, you can use Synchronization Frames. By putting a Rift Node in a Synchronization Frame, you can force the Overworld and Rift to overlap there, allowing any transfer of things between dimensions. Unfortunately, this overlap prevents Foci from functioning.

##Download and Installation##
Unfortunately, this mod is not currently available for download. It is still a heavy work-in-progress and being developed constantly. Even if it seems like there hasn't been a lot of development in some time, be patient; I have a life too.

When it is available, the download will be [here.](https://endreman0.github.io/EnderMechanics/download) (That will also not be a 404, and these parentheses won't be here.)

The Ender Mechanics Mod requires Minecraft version 1.7.10 and a properly-installed copy of MinecraftForge 10.13.0.1188 or later. Forge downloads can be found [here.](http://files.minecraftforge.net) Download the Forge installer, run it, and point it at your Minecraft directory. Open the launcher, click the "Forge" profile, and run Minecraft. Now you should have "mods" and "config" folders in your Minecraft directory. Put EnderMechanics.jar into the "mods" folder, run Minecraft, and the Ender Mechanics Mod should be loaded and ready to go!
