#Download and Installation#
Unfortunately, this mod is not currently available for download. It is still a heavy work-in-progress and being developed constantly. Even if it seems like there hasn't been a lot of development in some time, be patient; I have a life too.

When it is available, the download will be [here.](https://github.com/endreman0/EnderMechanics) (That will also be a functional link, and these parentheses won't be here.)

The Ender Mechanics Mod requires Minecraft version 1.7.10 and a properly-installed copy of MinecraftForge 10.13.0.1188 or later. Forge downloads can be found [here.](http://files.minecraftforge.net) Download the Forge installer, run it, and point it at your Minecraft directory. Open the launcher, click the "Forge" profile, and run Minecraft. Now you should have "mods" and "config" folders in your Minecraft directory.

Put EnderMechanics.jar into the "mods" folder, run Minecraft, and the Ender Mechanics Mod should be loaded and ready to go!
